# üò∫ Hi! I'm Jim üêà‚Äç‚¨õ

- I'm a Software Engineer who is getting ready to re-join the industry after being away for a while.

- There has been A LOT of change during my time away, so I am in the process of catching up with all the new stuff.

- I've been doing C# since .Net came out. In addition to brushing off those skills, I'm also re-visiting JavaScript, and learning TypeScript along with Node.js and Azure.
  
- My other repositories here on GitHub are the projects in what I am calling my Learning Journey. Whenever possible, I am also adding a GitHub Pages capability for each one, so anyone interested can see the code in action.

- Please see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimzuras/) for much more detail about my Learning Journey overall, and more specifics about each of the repos here.
